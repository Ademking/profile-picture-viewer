I highly recommend to not use these kinds of tricks to find and view private profile pictures, because all people like to maintain some privacy and they don't want others to disclose their privacy.

Please take in consideration that Fb is updating its Website regularly and thus could make the code throw errors. If any error encountered please open an new issue request
